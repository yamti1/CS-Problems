# CS-Problems
Computer Science problems and solutions.

## Branch Convension
The `master` branch contains all the problems with their final solutions.

Each problem has a development branch with the same name of the problem itself.

Then, each problem can have different feature branches of this format: `<problem-name>/<feature-name>`.

## Problem Convension
Each problem should be presented with an internal `README.md`. 

The file should describe the problem itself and the algorithm of the suggested solution.
